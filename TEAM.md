With 100 million active users around the world, BitTorrent owns two clients, BitTorrent and BitTorrent Now, the latter of which focuses on video/music. BitTorrent will continue to operate these clients from TRON’s San Francisco office, "providing strong support for TRON’s global business development and partnerships, with the vision to become the world's largest decentralized ecosystem."

In late July, BitTorrent was officially acquired by TRON with $140 million.
